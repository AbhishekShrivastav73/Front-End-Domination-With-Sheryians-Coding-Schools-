# React JS
- JavaScript Library for creating user interfaces.


## Introduction To React JS

Embark on the React JS journey! Discover the essentials in 'Introduction to React JS'. Uncover the basics and get started with this popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- UI Library
- for solving the real time problem (facebook build this cool library)
- for notification update on real time basically (2013).

### React JS Theory & History

Understanding React JS: Delve into its theory and historical roots. Explore the foundational aspects and historical development of React JS

- react -> lang X
- react -> framework X
- react -> technology X

- react -> library

- facebook - 2013

- 2015 - open source

#### Virtual DOM

- Copy of real DOM

jab websites par khhob sare change hote hai to khoob saara repaint hota hai wo bhi wo elements jo badle bhi nahi, aur ye website ko slow down kar deta hai, is cheej se bhi bachne ke liyein facebook ne react create ki gyi

- likes count, notification count side by side (change/update)

- when ever there is change in UI the DOM repaint or rerender things
- This is not the case with virtual DOM or with React. React solves this problem of not repaint Those part which was not updated or changed only re render things which are updated.

### React JS - Essentials - Everything you need to learn

Core Foundations of React JS: 'Essentials - Everything You Need to Learn'. Delve into essential components, foundational concepts, and crucial skills required to master React JS in this comprehensive guide

- array objects destructuring import and export

- map filter arrow fncs (implicit return) spread operator

- Copy array using spread operator

        let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

        // real copy

        let arr2 = [...arr];

        arr.pop();

        console.log(arr, arr2);


        // object copy

        let state = { name: "lucky", age: 23 };

        let stateCopy = { ...state };

        state.name = "HArsh";

        console.log(state, stateCopy);

- Object Destructuring

      let obj = { name: "lucky", age: 23 };

      let { name, age } = obj;

      console.log(name);
      console.log(age);

- Array Destructuring

        let arr = [12, function () {}];

        let [first, sec] = arr;

        console.log(first);
        console.log(sec);

- import export

- hum log component banaate hai, component matlab page ka hissaa

- navbar sidebar cart home landing page second page, ab dikkat yeh aati hai har hissa alag alag component hai aur components ko hum log alag alag files mein rakhte hai, to inko last mein jodna bhi padta hai, jodne ke liyein use hota hai import & export

- navbar - export

- sidebar - export

- cart - import navbar sidebar

- main - import navbar

       function Cart() {}

       export default Cart;

       export function Cart(){

       }

        import Cart from "./script";
        import { Cart } from ".script.js";

- arrow functions

      let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

      console.log(sum(10, 12));

- impicit return

        let value = val=>val+10;

        console.log(value(20));

- map filter

- dono hi array pe chlte hai, aur dono kaa kaam hai array par kuchh perform krna hand "ek naya array return karna"

      let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

- map - har element par kuch karo aur naye array mein rakho

      let arr2 = arr.map((item) => item * 10);

      console.log(arr2);

      let state = [11, 22, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14];

      let greaterFive = state.map((elem) => (elem > 5 ? elem + 5 : elem));

      console.log(greaterFive);

- map filter mein ek hi farak hai, map saare bande lautata hai matlab ki count kam nahi hoga, filter bando ko kam kar skta hai

- ek array mein sabhi nums jo ki 5 se bade hai unmein 10 add kro

- jab originl array ka size kam naa hona ho waha map use hota hai

- jab original array ka size kam krna ho toh wha filter use hota hai

- ek array mein se saare wo nums hata do jo ki 5 se chhote hai

- filter

      let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

      let filterArr = arr.filter((elem) => elem > 5);

      console.log(filterArr);

### Section 1: System Setup and Basics

Extensions:

- tabnine
- prettier

Download :

- node js
- use vite vs create react app

      npm create vite@latest

      vite project : setup

      cd setup
      npm i
      npm run dev

#### Understanding JSX

- jsx -> jsx is actually a very similar looking structure like HTMl but with super powers

- jsx sirf dikhta hai HTML ki trah par hota nhi

- It converted into React.createElement

- jsx is very similar to HTML but with superpowers

- conversion to javascript

      <h1>{login ? 'profile':'login'}</h1>


      <h1>Hey  {2 + 2}</h1>

      // output Hey 4

#### Making App

- Component

- React "react" when changes occurs

        function App(){

          return (
            <div>
            <h1>App Component</h1>
            </div>
          )
        }

- Component is a reusable code

### Section 2: Building Components

- Header

      import React from "react";

        const Header = () => {
          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Header</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Home</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Contact</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Skills</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">About</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Services</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          );
        };

        export default Header;

- Configure Tailwind CSS

- Creating Card Component

### Section 3: Reusable Components

- Use Array map method.

        const data = ["ajay", "rahul", "sachin", "udesh"];


        {data.map((item, index) => (
        <h1 key={index}>{item}</h1>
      ))}

- Showing Card With Data

- Create Array of data

      const data = [
        {
          image:'',
          name:'',
          desc:''
        }
      ]

- and use map method to use different data with card.

#### React Fragments

- unnecessary div creation stop
- Enclosed all elements in one wrapper without creating div or other element use React Fragment

          <>
          </>

        <React.Fragment>

        </React.Fragment>

### Section 4: Conditional Rendering

- Instock Check

      {item.inStock ? "InStock" : "Out Of Stock"}

- Handling Events:

        <button
            onClick={() => console.log("download song")}
          >
            Download Now
          </button>



            // seperatae function

           const handleClick = () => {

  console.log("mouse over event");
  };

### Section 5: Managing State and Understanding the State Hook

- state variable takes care of react updation

- It will take care of react changes

- state ek data hota hai, react is data ka khayaal rkhta hai, jab bhi ye data change hota hai react page ko update karta hai

- state koi bhi data ho skta hai, jaise ki score = 0

      const [score,setScore] = useState(0);


      // onClick par apply krdo

       const handleScore = () => {

          setScore(score + 1);
       };

- Based on Previous Value

      onClick={() => setVal((prev) => prev + 1)}

- Use object data in useState

        const [data,setData] = useState({name:'Lucky',isBanned:false});


        onClick={() => setData({ name: "Divyanshu", isBanned: true })}

        onClick={() => setData({ ...data, isBanned: !data.isBanned })}

#### Section 6 : Mastering the useState() hook

- useState not update synchronously

- add object property to useState

- useState state ko turant update nahi karta, wo useState state ko update karta hai apne hisaab se function completion ke baad to fix performance issue

      const [val, setVal] = useState({ name: "lucky",age: 23 });

      <h1>Name : {val.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age : {val.age}</h2>
      <h3>Role : {val.gender}</h3>

      <button
        className="px-3 py-1 mt-3 bg-red-500 text-md rounded-full"
        onClick={() => {setVal({ ...val, gender: "Male" })

        console.log(val);
        }

        }
      >
        Click
      </button>

- Use Array in useState

      {val.map((item, index) => (
        <h1 key={index}>{item}</h1>
      ))}

      <button
        onClick={() => setVal(() => val.filter((item, index) => index != 2))}
        // onClick={() =>
        //   setVal(() => {
        //     return val.filter((item, index) => index != val.length - 1);
        //   })
        // }
        className="px-3 py-1 text-md bg-blue-500 rounded-full text-white"
      >
        Change
      </button>

- Remove even values from an Array

      onClick={() =>
          setVal(() => val.filter((item, index) => item % 2 !== 0))
        }

- Arrays Addition

      onClick={() => setVal([...val, 10])}

- Change array of an object

         const [val, setVal] = useState([

            { name: "lucky", age: 23 },
            { name: "Shivam", age: 34 },
            { name: "golu", age: 25 },
        ]);

        onClick={() =>
          setVal(() =>
            val.map((item, index) =>
              item.name === "Shivam" ? { name: "Shivam", age: 55 } : item
            )
          )
        }
