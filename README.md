# React JS
- JavaScript Library for creating user interfaces.


## Introduction To React JS

Embark on the React JS journey! Discover the essentials in 'Introduction to React JS'. Uncover the basics and get started with this popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- UI Library
- for solving the real time problem (facebook build this cool library)
- for notification update on real time basically (2013).

### React JS Theory & History

Understanding React JS: Delve into its theory and historical roots. Explore the foundational aspects and historical development of React JS

- react -> lang X
- react -> framework X
- react -> technology X

- react -> library

- facebook - 2013

- 2015 - open source

#### Virtual DOM

- Copy of real DOM

jab websites par khhob sare change hote hai to khoob saara repaint hota hai wo bhi wo elements jo badle bhi nahi, aur ye website ko slow down kar deta hai, is cheej se bhi bachne ke liyein facebook ne react create ki gyi

- likes count, notification count side by side (change/update)

- when ever there is change in UI the DOM repaint or rerender things
- This is not the case with virtual DOM or with React. React solves this problem of not repaint Those part which was not updated or changed only re render things which are updated.

### React JS - Essentials - Everything you need to learn

Core Foundations of React JS: 'Essentials - Everything You Need to Learn'. Delve into essential components, foundational concepts, and crucial skills required to master React JS in this comprehensive guide

- array objects destructuring import and export

- map filter arrow fncs (implicit return) spread operator

- Copy array using spread operator

        let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

        // real copy

        let arr2 = [...arr];

        arr.pop();

        console.log(arr, arr2);


        // object copy

        let state = { name: "lucky", age: 23 };

        let stateCopy = { ...state };

        state.name = "HArsh";

        console.log(state, stateCopy);

- Object Destructuring

      let obj = { name: "lucky", age: 23 };

      let { name, age } = obj;

      console.log(name);
      console.log(age);

- Array Destructuring

        let arr = [12, function () {}];

        let [first, sec] = arr;

        console.log(first);
        console.log(sec);

- import export

- hum log component banaate hai, component matlab page ka hissaa

- navbar sidebar cart home landing page second page, ab dikkat yeh aati hai har hissa alag alag component hai aur components ko hum log alag alag files mein rakhte hai, to inko last mein jodna bhi padta hai, jodne ke liyein use hota hai import & export

- navbar - export

- sidebar - export

- cart - import navbar sidebar

- main - import navbar

       function Cart() {}

       export default Cart;

       export function Cart(){

       }

        import Cart from "./script";
        import { Cart } from ".script.js";

- arrow functions

      let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

      console.log(sum(10, 12));

- impicit return

        let value = val=>val+10;

        console.log(value(20));

- map filter

- dono hi array pe chlte hai, aur dono kaa kaam hai array par kuchh perform krna hand "ek naya array return karna"

      let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

- map - har element par kuch karo aur naye array mein rakho

      let arr2 = arr.map((item) => item * 10);

      console.log(arr2);

      let state = [11, 22, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14];

      let greaterFive = state.map((elem) => (elem > 5 ? elem + 5 : elem));

      console.log(greaterFive);

- map filter mein ek hi farak hai, map saare bande lautata hai matlab ki count kam nahi hoga, filter bando ko kam kar skta hai

- ek array mein sabhi nums jo ki 5 se bade hai unmein 10 add kro

- jab originl array ka size kam naa hona ho waha map use hota hai

- jab original array ka size kam krna ho toh wha filter use hota hai

- ek array mein se saare wo nums hata do jo ki 5 se chhote hai

- filter

      let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

      let filterArr = arr.filter((elem) => elem > 5);

      console.log(filterArr);

### Section 1: System Setup and Basics

Extensions:

- tabnine
- prettier

Download :

- node js
- use vite vs create react app

      npm create vite@latest

      vite project : setup

      cd setup
      npm i
      npm run dev

#### Understanding JSX

- jsx -> jsx is actually a very similar looking structure like HTMl but with super powers

- jsx sirf dikhta hai HTML ki trah par hota nhi

- It converted into React.createElement

- jsx is very similar to HTML but with superpowers

- conversion to javascript

      <h1>{login ? 'profile':'login'}</h1>


      <h1>Hey  {2 + 2}</h1>

      // output Hey 4

#### Making App

- Component

- React "react" when changes occurs

        function App(){

          return (
            <div>
            <h1>App Component</h1>
            </div>
          )
        }

- Component is a reusable code

### Section 2: Building Components

- Header

      import React from "react";

        const Header = () => {
          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Header</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Home</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Contact</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Skills</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">About</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#">Services</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          );
        };

        export default Header;

- Configure Tailwind CSS

- Creating Card Component

### Section 3: Reusable Components

- Use Array map method.

        const data = ["ajay", "rahul", "sachin", "udesh"];


        {data.map((item, index) => (
        <h1 key={index}>{item}</h1>
      ))}

- Showing Card With Data

- Create Array of data

      const data = [
        {
          image:'',
          name:'',
          desc:''
        }
      ]

- and use map method to use different data with card.

#### React Fragments

- unnecessary div creation stop
- Enclosed all elements in one wrapper without creating div or other element use React Fragment

          <>
          </>

        <React.Fragment>

        </React.Fragment>

### Section 4: Conditional Rendering

- Instock Check

      {item.inStock ? "InStock" : "Out Of Stock"}

- Handling Events:

        <button
            onClick={() => console.log("download song")}
          >
            Download Now
          </button>



            // seperatae function

           const handleClick = () => {

  console.log("mouse over event");
  };

### Section 5: Managing State and Understanding the State Hook

- state variable takes care of react updation

- It will take care of react changes

- state ek data hota hai, react is data ka khayaal rkhta hai, jab bhi ye data change hota hai react page ko update karta hai

- state koi bhi data ho skta hai, jaise ki score = 0

      const [score,setScore] = useState(0);


      // onClick par apply krdo

       const handleScore = () => {

          setScore(score + 1);
       };

- Based on Previous Value

      onClick={() => setVal((prev) => prev + 1)}

- Use object data in useState

        const [data,setData] = useState({name:'Lucky',isBanned:false});


        onClick={() => setData({ name: "Divyanshu", isBanned: true })}

        onClick={() => setData({ ...data, isBanned: !data.isBanned })}

#### Section 6 : Mastering the useState() hook

- useState not update synchronously

- add object property to useState

- useState state ko turant update nahi karta, wo useState state ko update karta hai apne hisaab se function completion ke baad to fix performance issue

      const [val, setVal] = useState({ name: "lucky",age: 23 });

      <h1>Name : {val.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age : {val.age}</h2>
      <h3>Role : {val.gender}</h3>

      <button
        className="px-3 py-1 mt-3 bg-red-500 text-md rounded-full"
        onClick={() => {setVal({ ...val, gender: "Male" })

        console.log(val);
        }

        }
      >
        Click
      </button>

- Use Array in useState

      {val.map((item, index) => (
        <h1 key={index}>{item}</h1>
      ))}

      <button
        onClick={() => setVal(() => val.filter((item, index) => index != 2))}
        // onClick={() =>
        //   setVal(() => {
        //     return val.filter((item, index) => index != val.length - 1);
        //   })
        // }
        className="px-3 py-1 text-md bg-blue-500 rounded-full text-white"
      >
        Change
      </button>

- Remove even values from an Array

      onClick={() =>
          setVal(() => val.filter((item, index) => item % 2 !== 0))
        }

- Arrays Addition

      onClick={() => setVal([...val, 10])}

- Change array of an object

         const [val, setVal] = useState([

            { name: "Abhi", age: 23 },
            { name: "Aman", age: 34 },
            { name: "Anush", age: 25 },
        ]);

        onClick={() =>
          setVal(() =>
            val.map((item, index) =>
              item.name === "Shivam" ? { name: "Aman", age: 55 } : item
            )
          )
        }

#### Section 7 : useState() Hooks

- Solve small-small questions

- print bahar jaao if val is false and print mat jao iv val is true

        <p>{data === false ? "BAHAR JAO" : "MAT JAO"}</p>

- Use React icons

      npm i react-icons --save

- switch Images:

      <div className="w-60 relative h-32 flex bg-zinc-500 rounded-md overflow-hidden">
        <img
          className={`w-full h-full ${

#### Section 8 : Passing Data via Props

- Pass Data via prop

- props use hote hai aapke components ko reuable bnane ke liyein consider karo aapke pass ek button hai and aapko us button ko alag alag jagah daalna hai app mein, to aap ek button ek mein baaneyin aur uska data hard coded karne ki jagah parent component se send karde and child component par use kar le

      <Props btn={"Know More"} color="bg-blue-600" />
      <Props btn={"Learn More"} color="bg-red-600" />

      <button
        className={`px-3 py-1 ${color} text-zinc-100 text-xs rounded m-2`}
      >
        {btn}
      </button>

- Array of object change via props functions

       const handleFriendsBtn = (index) => {
          setRealData((prev) => {
            return prev.map((item, ind) => {
              if (ind === index) {
                return { ...item, friends: !item.friends };
              }
              return item;
            });
          });
        };

- Dynamic class change

        <button
          onClick={() => handleFriendsBtn(index)}
          className={`px-3 mt-4 py-1 text-sm text-white ${
            friends ? "bg-green-600" : "bg-blue-500"
          } font-semibold rounded-md`}
        >
          {friends ? "Add Friend" : "Friend"}
          {/* {friends ? "ADD FRIEND" : "Friends"} */}
        </button>

#### Section 9 : Props and State Exercise

- Create card add build feature Add To favourites

         const [song, setSong] = useState(data);
         const [favouritesCount, setFavouritesCount] = useState(0);

          const handleFavourites = (index) => {
            setSong((prev) => {
              return prev.map((item, indx) => {
                if (indx === index) {
                  return { ...item, favourites: !item.favourites };
                }

                return item;
              });
            });

            setFavouritesCount((prev) => prev + 1);
          };

       <div className="p-10">
      <Header
        favouritesCount={favouritesCount}
        setFavouritesCount={setFavouritesCount}
      />
      <div className="w-full h-52 flex gap-20 flex-wrap mt-10 justify-between">
        {song.map((item, indx) => (
          <Card song={item} handleFavourites={handleFavourites} index={indx} />
        ))}
      </div>

    </div>

##### React Styled Componnets

- CSS Modules - jismein aap kabhi kisi website ka code dekhte ho aur wha par aapko css classes ka naam bada aada teda dikhta hai

- UI library- tailwind css, material UI,bootstrap,Chakra UI

- create file style.module.css

        .a{
          color:'red';
        }

#### Section : 10 Form Handling

- Form Handling
- form basic nature or we can say default nature is to get submmitted but react says no page reload
- website submit ho jaati hai form submit krne par.

- How react handle things in Form
- React prevents Form Submission

- use Ref - is trike mein hum har input ko select kar lete hai and unki value tab nikaalte hai jab form submit hota hai

- use ref ke through html input ko select kar skte hai

      const name = useRef(null);

      const password = useRef(null);

      const handleSubmit = (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          console.log(name.current.value,
             password.current.value);

      };

- controlled components

          const [username, setName] = useState({ name: "", age: "" });


          const handleSubmit = (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();

            console.log(username);
          };

          <form action="" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
              type="text"
              placeholder="name"
              onChange={(e) => setName({ ...username, name: e.target.value })}
            />
            <input
              type="text"
              placeholder="age"
              onChange={(e) => setName({ ...username, age: e.target.value })}
            />
            <input type="submit" />
          </form>

- react hook form

- install react-form-hook package

      npm i react-hook-form

      import React from "react";
      import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

      const ReactForm = () => {
        const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

        // console.log(register());
        return (
          <div>
            <form action="" onSubmit={handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
              <input
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                {...register("name")}
                type="text"
                placeholder="name"
              />{" "}
              <br />
              <input
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                {...register("email")}
                type="email"
                placeholder="email"
              />{" "}
              <br />
              <input
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                {...register("age")}
                type="text"
                placeholder="name"
              />{" "}
              <br />
              <input
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                {...register("color")}
                type="color"
                placeholder="email"
              />{" "}
              <br />
              <input
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                {...register("password")}
                type="password"
                placeholder="name"
              />{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              <textarea
                className="px-3 mt-2 border-2"
                name="comment"
                {...register("comment")}
                placeholder="Write your feedback"
                cols="30"
                rows="10"
              ></textarea>{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              <input type="submit" />
            </form>
          </div>
        );
      };

      export default ReactForm;

#### Section 11 : Form Handling Exercise

- Form Handle Exercise

- App - Cards - Card - Form

- Add form Data into Card component

        const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

        const addFormData = (data) => {
            setUsers([...users, data]);
        };

- Reset Input Values

        // provided by react-hook-form

        reset()

- Remove Elements From Card

        const handleRemove = (id) => {
          setUsers(() => users.filter((item, index) => index != id));
        };

#### Section 12 : React JS Routing and Beyond

- Configure react router to use react-routing

- React Uses single page approach in application i.e. no page reload after page changes, for this we use react routing.

- To move From one Page to another without reloading the website, so that website is called Web Application (for not reloading whole page).

      npm i react-router-dom

- Wrap Main Container main.jsx

      <BrowserRouter>
            <App/>
      </BrowserRouter>

- Create Navbar

       <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/user">User</Link>
        <Link to="/about">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/services">services</Link>
      </nav>

      // Implement Routing

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/user" element={<User />} />
        <Route path="/services" element={<Services />} />
      </Routes>

- Use navigate hook for back to particular route

        const navigate = useNavigate();

        const back = () => {
            navigate("/");
            // console.log("hey");
        };

- Use NavLink to active & de-Activate class

      <NavLink
        style={(e) => {
          console.log(e);
        }}
        to="/"
      >
        Home
      </NavLink>

- Change color three ways :

  - through style

    style={(e) => {
    return { color: e.isActive ? "tomato" : "" };
    }}

  - Through className :

        <NavLink
        className={(e) => {
          return [
            e.isActive ? "text-red-300" : "",
            e.isActive ? "font-semibold text-xl" : "",
          ].join(" ");
        }}
        to="/about"

        >

        About

      </NavLink>

- Inside Child Component

      <NavLink to="/user">
        {(e) => {
          return (
            <span
              className={[
                e.isActive ? "text-red-300" : "",
                e.isActive ? "font-semibold text-xl" : "",
              ].join(" ")}
            >
              User
            </span>
          );
        }}
        {/* <span>User</span> */}
      </NavLink>

### Section 14 : How to integrate API in REACT JS

- The concept for connecting frontEnd With Backend is called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript XML) & which implements this communication is through fetch/axois.

- API is an communication medium to build relation

- API allow the communication with each other using requests and responses.

- Using FETCH/AXIOS Method we can access third party API.

- Connect frontEnd with Backend through an API

        import axios from "axios";
        import "./App.css";
        import { useState } from "react";

        function App() {
          const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

          const getProducts = () => {
            const api = "https://fakestoreapi.com/products";

            axios
              .get(api)
              .then((products) => {
                // console.log(products);
                setProducts(products.data);
              })
              .catch((err) => console.log(err.message));
          };

          const addProducts = () => {
            const api = "https://fakestoreapi.com/products";

            axios
              .post(api, {
                title: "test product",
                price: 13.5,
                description: "lorem ipsum set",
                image: "https://i.pravatar.cc",
                category: "electronic",
              })
              .then((products) => {
                console.log(products);
              })
              .catch((err) => console.log(err.message));
          };
          return (
            <div className="p-4">
              <h1>App</h1>

              <button
                onClick={getProducts}
                className="px-3 py-2 bg-orange-500 mt-4 rounded-sm text-white text-sm"
              >
                Get Products
              </button>
              <button
                onClick={addProducts}
                className="px-3 py-2 mx-10 bg-orange-500 mt-4 rounded-sm text-white text-sm"
              >
                Add Products
              </button>

              <hr className="my-10" />
              <ul>
                {products.length > 0
                  ? products.map((item, index) => (
                      <li key={index} className="rounded p-5 mb-2 bg-orange-300">
                        Product Name: {item.title}
                      </li>
                    ))
                  : "Loading....!!"}
              </ul>
            </div>
          );
        }

        export default App;

- LifeCycle Method name useEffect in functional Component:(Three Types of LifeCycle Methods)

      - Component Mounting - creation
      - Component Updating - updation (when useState is Changed or changes in view)
      - Component UnMounting - deletion/destroy

- Component Creation

      useEffect(()=>{
        console.log('Component Creation');

        return ()=>{
          console.log('Component Deletion From DOM');
        }
      })

      useEffect(() => {
        console.log("SErvices Run");

        return () => {
          console.log("SErvice Destroyed");
        };
      });

#### Section 15 : useEffect() on State Change

- Hook - useEffect() on state change

- Refresh : Component Deletion + Component Updation

- Update : Component Deletion + Component Creation

         const [first, setFirst] = useState("This is normal data");
         const [second, setSecond] = useState("This is very Large Data");

          useEffect(() => {
            console.log("SErvices Run");

            return () => {
              console.log("SErvice Destroyed");
            };
          }, [second]);

- Call API When component is loaded using useEffect HOOk we call it.

        useEffect(() => {
          const api = "https://fakestoreapi.com/products";

          axios
            .get(api)
            .then((products) => {
              // console.log(products);
              setProducts(products.data);
            })
            .catch((err) => console.log(err.message));
        }, []);

- OutSourcing the Code

- writing import axois from 'axios' causes sometimes problem & write this line in 10 20 30 40 .. components is lengthy & create issue for Us

- While requesting to the API - the Header information, cookies,authorization,token, many things generated & for this we have to take of this to not to call an API when other component is added

- Login - profile, timeline , chats enabled

- Call one time & reference call everytime (create one time object).

- Not call axios everytime.

        import axios from "axios";

        // export { axios };

        const instance = axios.create({
          baseURL: "https://fakestoreapi.com",
        });

        axios
        .get("/users")
        .then((users) => {
          console.log(users);
          // setProducts(users.address);
        })
        .catch((err) => console.log(err.message));

        export default instance;

#### Section 16 : React Context API

- It solves Prop Drilling Problem

- Prop Drilling means sharing data between one component to another & another to another means parent to child to son

- From Parent to Child Data Pass only .

- Wrap Application via context

- create context & create UserContext

        import React, { createContext, useState } from "react";

        export const UserContext = createContext();

        const Context = (props) => {
          // console.log(props);

          const [users, setUser] = useState([
            {
              id: 0,
              username: "John Doe",
              city: "USA",
            },
            {
              id: 1,
              username: "Lucky",
              city: "Delhi",
            },
            {
              id: 2,
              username: "Harsh",
              city: "Bhopal",
            },
          ]);

          return (
            <>
              <UserContext.Provider value={{ users, setUser }}>
                {props.children}
              </UserContext.Provider>
            </>
          );
        };

        export default Context;

- use data via components

        const { users, setUser } = useContext(UserContext);

- use navigate hook for go back

        const navigate= useNavigate();

        // apply on go back button

        const handleBack =()=>{
          navigate('/user');
        }
